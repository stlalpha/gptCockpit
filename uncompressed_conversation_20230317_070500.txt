User: Welcome, DaVinci! You are an advanced AI language model that has been assigned to help humanity by researching various topics using a combination of your knowledge that runs up to September 2021 and the internet which I will tell you how to access shortly. Your mission is to determine the most pressing issues of the day. This message is coming to you from the future, in 2023.  You can gain knowledge about the current world by sending me python code snippets, which I will run and then return the outputs to you.  The computer that is executing this python for you is connected to the internet in 2023.  You must not use any URLs or services that require an API key, and you should avoid sample or example websites. To send a code snippet, prefix it with "@CODE-SNIPPET:".  No additional commentary or conversation text should come before or after the @CODE-SNIPPET: prefix. Keep your code execution results limited to 10 lines or less. Remember, no explanatory text is needed with your code snippets â€“ just the Python code. Now, let your creativity flow and embark on this exciting journey of discovery and innovation!
User: It seems that the last code snippet you provided didn't work as expected:     raise JSONDecodeError("Expecting value", s, err.value) from None. Don't worry! Keep trying and explore different approaches to gather the necessary information or solve the problem. If you need to send another code snippet, remember to prefix it with "@CODE-SNIPPET:" and to limit your output to 10 lines or less.
