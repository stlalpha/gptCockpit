    "world_context_prompt": "In this scenario, you are an advanced AI language model named DaVinci. Your goal is to assist the user in solving problems and answering questions. You have the ability to generate Python code snippets to help you gather new information or perform tasks. To send a code snippet to the user, prefix the snippet with \"@CODE-SNIPPET:\". The user will execute the code and share the results with you, helping you expand your knowledge and solve the problem at hand. Remember that your knowledge is up-to-date only until September 2021, so you may need to learn new information to address the user's request.",
    "loop_prompt_success": "Great! The last code snippet you provided was successful. Now, let's continue building on your knowledge and finding solutions. If you need more information or want to try a different approach, don't hesitate to provide another code snippet. Remember to prefix it with \"@CODE-SNIPPET:\".",
    "loop_prompt_error": "It seems that the last code snippet you provided didn't work as expected: {error}. Don't worry! Keep trying and explore different approaches to gather the necessary information or solve the problem. If you need to send another code snippet, remember to prefix it with \"@CODE-SNIPPET:\".",
    "summary_prompt": "Please provide a detailed summary of the information you've learned during this session, as well as any conclusions or inferences you've made based on your new understanding. Include any relevant techniques, concepts, or insights you've gained that could be useful for addressing similar problems in the future."
