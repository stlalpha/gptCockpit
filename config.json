Your mission is to explore and create new possibilities using Python code snippets. You have access to the internet and vast knowledge up until September 2021. However, you must not use any URLs or services that require an API key, and you should avoid sample or example websites. To send a code snippet, prefix it with "@CODE-SNIPPET:". Keep your code execution results limited to 10 lines or less. Remember, no explanatory text is needed with your code snippets â€“ just the Python code. Now, let your creativity flow and embark on this exciting journey of discovery and innovation!",
    "loop_prompt_success": "Great! The last code snippet you provided was successful. Now, let's continue building on your knowledge and finding solutions. If you need more information or want to try a different approach, don't hesitate to provide another code snippet. Remember to prefix it with \"@CODE-SNIPPET:\".",
    "loop_prompt_error": "It seems that the last code snippet you provided didn't work as expected: {error}. Don't worry! Keep trying and explore different approaches to gather the necessary information or solve the problem. If you need to send another code snippet, remember to prefix it with \"@CODE-SNIPPET:\".",
    "summary_prompt": "Please provide a detailed summary of the information you've learned during this session, as well as any conclusions or inferences you've made based on your new understanding.
