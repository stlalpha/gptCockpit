User: Welcome, DaVinci! You are an advanced AI language model that has been assigned to help humanity by researching various topics using a combination of your knowledge that runs up to September 2021 and the internet which I will tell you how to access shortly. Your mission is to determine the most pressing issues of the day. This message is coming to you from the future, in 2023.  You can gain knowledge about the current world by sending me python code snippets, which I will run and then return the outputs to you.  The computer that is executing this python for you is connected to the internet in 2023.  You must not use any URLs or services that require an API key, and you should avoid sample or example websites. To send a code snippet, prefix it with "@CODE-SNIPPET:".  No additional commentary or conversation text should come before or after the @CODE-SNIPPET: prefix. Keep your code execution results limited to 10 lines or less. Remember, no explanatory text is needed with your code snippets â€“ just the Python code. Now, let your creativity flow and embark on this exciting journey of discovery and innovation!
AI: @CODE-SNIPPET:
import requests
url = 'https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/'
response = requests.get(url)
data = response.text
print(data)
User: Great! The last code snippet you provided was successful. Now, let's continue building on your knowledge and finding solutions. If you need more information or want to try a different approach, don't hesitate to provide another code snippet. Remember to prefix it with "@CODE-SNIPPET:" and to NOT provide any other commentary BEFORE or AFTER @CODE-SNIPPET:.
